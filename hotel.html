    <p>In the middle of the driest desert in the world and surrounded by incredible natural wonders is four/five star Cumbres San Pedro Hotel (formerly Kunza), although very austere, with a magical architecture inspired on the ancient ayllu (traditional form of a community in the Andes) of the Atacama. It has 60 spacious rooms, all of 52 m2 (170 ft2), with a private terrace and decorated in harmony with the environment.</p><p>Its gastronomic proposal amicably joins local ingredients with high cuisine techniques. It has a restaurant and bar in the main building, plus another in the Spa area, which charms with its three pools and two outdoor jacuzzis, two wet and two dry saunas, fitness equipment, massage and therapy services. Its convention center with 
capacity for 150 people and technologically equipped, makes it the perfect place to combine business and leisure.</p>
